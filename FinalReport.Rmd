# Usually, I list all the required packages here.

## Reason 1: Put your package imports at the start so you won’t run into trouble with missing functions later. It’s like getting all your tools ready before you start working.

## Reason 2: When you import at the beginning, every following R chunk can use these packages because RMarkdown goes through your code step by step, from top to bottom.

## Reason 3: You won’t see any messages here because we’ve used "include=FALSE", which means it keeps the output clean and tidy.

# Introduction and Research question

E.g. authors: "Kobe and Rachel(Des)"

![](images/clipboard-1426687266.png)As a group a people who plan to have a STEM related career. Sleep is important its what gives us the energy to properly do our jobs. The following data set will allow us to research what factors contribute to sleep quality and stress levels for individuals in the workforce. This data set has 375 cases and a case is an individual in the workforce.

```{r}
df <- read.csv("sleepdata.csv")

# Occupation and Sleep duration

With different occupations being faced with different challenges in not only life but in profession their sleep is bound to be affected. Within this graph we are able to view how the averages change based off the occupation. With the graph and the table we are able to see how the sleep duration ranges from 5.8 hours as the min and 8.5 hours as the max. Along within this visualization we're able to see how engineers have the highest average sleep while sale represenatives show the lowest average sleep.

# Occupation and Stress

The key feature that we plan to resaerch within our dataset is stress. As our hypothesis is that stress is a leading feature into what causes issues within sleep duration and quality. As you can see sale represenatives stand our with the highest amount of stress which supports our hypothesis as they also have the lowest average sleep duration. This is an idea that we plan to study and show correlation to throughout this research. 

```{r}

#Average Stress Levels per Occupation Table
avgStressLevels <- data %>%
  group_by(Occupation)%>%
  summarize(avgStressLevels = mean(Stress.Level))

#Avg Stress Levels for Each Occupation

    values = c(Accountant = "#440154",
               Doctor = "#CEA2FD",

# Statics

These metrics provide a comprehensive overview of variability, central tendency, and outliers within our study population, informing research on sleep health and potential interventions. Analyzing these statistics aids in identifying risk factors associated with inadequate or excessive sleep duration and contributes to our understanding of sleep's impact on overall well-being. Using this we're able to show that some testers arent reaching the necessary amount of sleep within Q1-Q3. Showing that testers only were able to reach the recommended amount of sleep within Q4.

```{r}

sleepDurStats <- data%>%
  select(SleepDuration) %>%
  summarize(
    Min = min(data$Sleep.Duration, na.rm = TRUE),
    Q1 = quantile(data$Sleep.Duration, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(data$Sleep.Duration, na.rm = TRUE),
    Q3 = quantile(data$Sleep.Duration, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),
    Q4 = quantile(data$Sleep.Duration, probs = 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(data$Sleep.Duration, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean = mean(data$Sleep.Duration, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(data$Sleep.Duration, na.rm = TRUE)
  )%>%
  round(., 2)

#Polished Sleep Duration Descr. Stats Table
# sleepDurKable <- sleepDurStats %>%
sleepDurStats %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Sleep Duration Descriptive Statistics",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    align = c("c",rep("c",6))
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped"),
    font_size = 16
  )

# print(sleepDurKable)



```   



Within this data set many user present stress. It ranges from 3 as the minimum and 8 has the maximum. The metric is used to quanitfy stress in terms of no stress to extremely stresssed. This allows us to assign a correlation to stress and things like occupation and sleep duration. 

```{r}
stressStats <- data%>%
  select(Stress.Level) %>%
  summarize(
    Min = min(data$Stress.Level, na.rm = TRUE),
    Q1 = quantile(data$Stress.Level, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(data$Stress.Level, na.rm = TRUE),
    Q3 = quantile(data$Stress.Level, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),
    Q4 = quantile(data$Stress.Level, probs = 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(data$Stress.Level, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean = mean(data$Stress.Level, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(data$Stress.Level, na.rm = TRUE)
    )%>%
  round(., 2)

#Polished Stress Level Descr. Stats Table
stressStats %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Stress Level Descriptive Statistics",
    booktabs = TRUE,

# SQL Statics

Using different packages like SQL we're able to show both the frequency and the probability. The frequency shows us that most cases show have a sleep duration of 6 hours and also is proven in the probability as we calculated that is the most likely sleep duration. Along with 6.1 being the second most likely sleep duration. Which both are below the recommended amount from the CDC .

```{r}

library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

# Connect to an SQLite database
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "SleepHealth.db")

# Step 1: Read the CSV file
rawsleepdata <- read.csv("sleepdata.csv")

# Drop the existing "sleepdata" table if it exists
dbExecute(con, "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sleepdata")

# Write the data frame to the SQLite database
dbWriteTable(con, "sleepdata", rawsleepdata)

# Check if the table has been created in the database
dbListTables(con)

# Query to get frequency table
query <- "
  

SELECT 
    SleepDuration,
    COUNT(SleepDuration) AS frequency,
    COUNT(SleepDuration) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(SleepDuration) FROM sleepdata) AS probability
  
    
FROM 
    sleepdata
GROUP BY 
    SleepDuration
ORDER BY 
    SleepDuration;


  

"
#Find the probabilty of someone having a sleep duration under 7 and then find the vice versa.

#Find the probability of someone with a good sleep quality having a high stress levels.

#Find the correlation percentage between stress and sleep duration vs sleep duration and sleep disorders 

# Execute the query
tryCatch({
  result <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
  head(result)
}, error = function(e) {
  print(paste("Error:", e$message))
})



```

# Conclusions

In conclusion with our research into sleep heatlh we've determined that stress is the leading cause of lower sleep duration. This visualization below also confirms that with line graph showing how those with high stress have a decreased sleep duration compared to others.
```{r}
ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = Stress.Level, y = Sleep.Duration) +
  geom_line(colour = "#112446") +
  labs(title = "Correlation between stress and sleep") +
  theme_minimal()
