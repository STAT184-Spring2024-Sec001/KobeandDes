```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Usually, I list all the required packages here.

## Reason 1: Put your package imports at the start so you won’t run into trouble with missing functions later. It’s like getting all your tools ready before you start working.

## Reason 2: When you import at the beginning, every following R chunk can use these packages because RMarkdown goes through your code step by step, from top to bottom.

## Reason 3: You won’t see any messages here because we’ve used "include=FALSE", which means it keeps the output clean and tidy.

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

# The First Section - Header Level 1

E.g. author: "Xinyue Wang, Xinyue Wang" (on the same line)

The example shown above demonstrates how to place each entry on its own line.

We can make use of the Markdown syntax `^[]` (in the author section) to add additional information as a footnote to the document.

Adding items/lists:

1. oibnapoiejgo

2. boincvoeiwtj

3. obsfinaierugj

- unnumbered items

  - sublist
  
- sdbowiengwei

Insert R chunks:

```{r}
print("Hello, Make sure to include extra empty lines before and after each paragraph in your Rmarkdown file for proper formatting.")
# comments just like in a R script
```

Otherwise, you will see this.
**This line is supposed to be on the next line, but it isn't currently.**

We want this.

`\newpage` will not work for HTML because web pages do not have 'pages' in the traditional sense. However, it will work for PDF and Word documents.

Comment out text:

In RStudio, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + C (Command + Shift + C on macOS)` to comment out a line of text. (You can see the "inline" code format here.)

<!-- 
This is the HTML syntax to comment out text.
your comment ......
They will not be displayed in any output format.
-->

<!-- For a single line...... -->


## Header Level 2

### More Markdown Editing Mode (Header Level 3)

**Bold**

*italic*

`code`

<link>

Inline math like $\lambda=0$.

Display Math between lines:

$$
Y = \sum_{i=1}^{100}i \\
Y = aX+b
$$




Moving everything else to the next page (in pdf/Word) using `\newpage` like this.

\newpage


# The Second Section

More details, such as font size, font color, table format, and figure format, can be found in the reference at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/>.

To ensure your report is well-organized, use a clear outline that includes sections such as Introduction/Background, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. You don't have to follow this strictly, but including some of these would be helpful. This structure will guide the reader through your research or analysis in a logical and comprehensive manner.


# This section is unnumbered {-}

If you delete `number_sections: true` in the YAML header, all sections will be "unnumbered".

Hints for Activity 09: 

- "Question from Neil" is indeed the original question. I kept the name since Activity 03 was designed by Dr. Neil Hatfield.

- Use the `kable` function in Activity 09. Example code is available in Week 7.

- When transitioning from a plain histogram to ggplot, ensure the input is a data frame instead of a vector.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# define your functions first

# call your function and save the results for the first 10,000 integers to an object

# make it a data frame
dat <- data.frame(stopping_numbers = your_object) # change the contents accordingly

# draw a histogram
ggplot(dat, aes(x = stopping_numbers)) +
  geom_histogram(...) +
  ...
```

- Activity 09 on the MyOpenMath page serves as checkpoints; three required files should be **submitted via the Submission portal on Canvas**, see the second option here:

![](Submission of Activity 09.png){width=80%}

I will need three files, and all of them (local files) should be uploaded to Canvas. Do **not** use any links for HTML files.
